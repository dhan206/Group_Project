# ConcerFindr

ConcerFindr is a web service that allows you to search for local music events in whatever city you are in or are traveling to!

You can find the website hosted [here](http://http://students.washington.edu/kaiyosh/info343/challenges/Group_Project/#/).

Type in the name of any city around the world to see what's playing in the area. You can even see if they are on spotify from the markers on the map!
